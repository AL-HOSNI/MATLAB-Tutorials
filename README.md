# MatLab-Tutorials

This Standalone Program is designed for Brain Tumor Detection using Grayscale Images.

It's a simple program that gives great results.

It uses Image Thresholding Technique for Tumor detection, also a simple dilation process is done for more accuracy.

It's all free to use, but keep supporting me, just mention my repo here on Github.com

Importnat Notes:

There is a difference between a brain and a brain tumor, in a nutshell the solidity of the tumor is much greater than the brain solidity.

This concept is taken into consideration while writing the MatLab Code, where the pixels of a tumor is likely to be almost the same
than the pixels of the brain itself.
