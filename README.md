# MatLab-Tutorials

This Standalone Program is designed for Brain Tumor Detection using Grayscale Images, or even RGB ones.

It's a simple program that gives great results.

It uses Image Thresholding Technique for Tumor detection, also a simple dilation process is done for more accuracy.

It depends on the solidity of each part inside the brain, i.e. the skull, the brain itself, and the tumor.

The tumor has the highest solidity among them.

You can also watch my tutorial on youtube.com at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeFRo7uALhM

It's all free to use, but keep supporting me, just mention my repo here on Github.com

# Importnat Notes:

There is a difference between a brain and a brain tumor, in a nutshell the solidity of the tumor is much greater than the brain solidity.

This concept is taken into consideration while writing the MatLab Code, where the pixels of a tumor is likely to be almost the same
than the pixels of the brain itself.

You have to have a 64-bit machine and Matlab to run the application, and also you must have Matlab 8.5 compiler to make the application work. To download Matlab 8.5 compiler visit: http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/

Download the 8.5 Compiler compatible with your Matlab Version
